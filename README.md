2.  Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/omidnavy/nodejs-microservice-boilerplate.git`
3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd nodejs-microservice-boilerplate`.<br />
4.  Run `npm install` in order to install dependencies .<br />
5.  Run `npm start` to run sample.

Now you're ready to rumble!

> Please note that this boilerplate is **production-ready**!

# Documentation

1.  First, let's make a [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) name it `RouteMapper.proto` and put it inside `/app/core/`.

1.  Open `/app/core/RouteMapperMapper.js` and edit `packageName` and `serviceName` variable depends on you `.proto` file.

1.  For every rpc function defined in your proto, you must have a component.
    - Create a folder inside `app/components` same as your rpc function name. `eg. SayHello` 
    - Now make a `[x]Controller.js` inside this folder where `x` is your component name. use `/app/components/SayHello/SayHelloController.js` as your template.
    - You can declare model classes inside your component folder then require it in your controller class. Use `/app/components/SayHello/myModel.js` as your template.
    - There is a `BaseController` and `BaseModel` class inside `/app/core/` which can have your common things for controllers and models.
    
1.  Time to run your app:

    ```shell
    npm run start
    ```


### Database Class

There is a simple `BaseDBModel` in `/app/core/` which is using `mysql` pooled connections wrapped in a promised based function.
  You can check the commented sample code for using it.
  You can modify it to use with other databases or remove it completely from your app if you don't need databases . don't forget to clean the code and uninstall `mysql` client using following command if you decide to remove or change database.
  ```shell
  npm uninstall -s mysql
  ``` 

### Helpers

Helpers are shared functions that can be called from anywhere in your app. here we use `global variables` to define our helper functions.
There is `logger` helper function defined as sample , you can call it with `logger()` where ever you want. there is a child process for calling logger function to reduce cpu load on main app (don't take it serious , its just a showcase).

### Process

If you want to use child process, you can use `/app/core/child-process/winston.js` as your template.
